Subqueries

-- Subqueries means Nested query.query within query.
-- Two queries are there, inner and outer query.
-- If one query is not enough to get the output, use subquery
-- If we have to use 2 tables for output, use subquery
-- We cannot use aggregate function and  select * simultaneously in a simple query.
-- We can’t use select * in inner query
-- In outer query, whatever column name we have used in where clause, 
   we have to use that column name only or column
   having same type of data in the inner query.
-- Innermost query runs first, then outer query runs.
